Click here to launch a pre-configured notebook environment on the cloud platform provided freely by the binder project. Use the Chrome browser if you have trouble loading that page. Refresh the page if loading fails.

If the page is loaded successfully, you should see a Jupyter notebook interface. Then, click on the first notebook to get started. Jupyter combines Python code, execution results, plots, custom texts, and even Latex formulas in a single page. Besides using the Jupyter program, you can also view the static notebook on GitHub (e.g the first notebook).
