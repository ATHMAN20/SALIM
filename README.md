[Click here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rohithocean/Sea_Level_Data_Analysis/main) to launch a pre-configured notebook environment on the cloud platform provided freely by the  [binder project](https://mybinder.org). Use the Chrome browser if you have trouble loading that page. Refresh the page if loading fails.

If the page is loaded successfully, you should see a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html) interface. Then, click on the first notebook to get started. Jupyter combines Python code, execution results, plots, custom texts, and even Latex formulas in a single page. Besides using the Jupyter program, you can also view the static notebook on GitHub (e.g the first notebook).

Please follow [Jupyter official doc](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html) to learn basic operations. The most important command is Shift+Enter to execute the current code block.
